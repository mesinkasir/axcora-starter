## üß© Using Components in Markdown & Templating

Axcora enables **per-page component usage** via frontmatter in your markdown and `.axcora` template layouts. The build system will analyze your needs and automatically bundle and minify only the CSS and JS you specify‚Äîresulting in highly optimized, modern static sites.

### Markdown Article Example

```markdown
---
title: "Blockquote"
date: "2025-08-22"
tags: 
  - blockquote
  - blockquote axcora
  - blockquote components
category: "components"
description: "How to use blockquote component"
image: "/img/ax-1.jpg"
css:
  theme: 'essentials'
  components:
    - buttons
    - navbar
    - blockquote
    - hero
    - breadcrumb
    - pagination
    - image
    - cards
js:
  - navbar
  - theme
---
The **Blockquote component** in Axcora SSG provides a visually appealing way to display quotations, statements, or testimonials, allowing emphasis and proper attribution for quoted material within both templates and article content.

> ‚ÄúThis is a sample blockquote. Use it to highlight important content, testimonials, or citations.‚Äù
```

- **What happens?**  
  - Only listed CSS components and JS modules will be included for this page.
  - Axcora generates optimized, minified CSS/JS based on this configuration.
  - You can use blockquotes and other components directly in your markdown content, taking advantage of the imported styles and logic.

---

### Axcora Templating Example (`.axcora`)

Frontmatter and template code (`src/templates/blog/single.axcora`):

```axcora
---
layouts: base
css:
  theme: 'essentials'
  components:
    - buttons
    - navbar
    - badge
    - hero
    - breadcrumb
    - pagination
    - cards
js:
  - navbar
  - theme
---
<header class="hero container content-start mb-3">
  <div class="hero-content">
    <h1>
      <a href="{{url}}" class="text-white text-decoration-none">{{ name }}</a>
    </h1>
    <p class="lead text-muted">{{ description }}</p>
  </div>
</header>

<!-- Usage in template (example): -->
<blockquote class="axcora-blockquote">
  <p>{{ quote }}</p>
  <footer>{{ author }}</footer>
</blockquote>
```

- **What happens?**  
  - Each template can define its own CSS/JS needs in its frontmatter.
  - When rendered, the page will include only the selected CSS components and JavaScript for optimal performance.
  - Use all Axcora UI elements (e.g. blockquote, badges, buttons) directly in your layouts, inheriting from the theme and components you specify.

---

### üí° **Why Component-Level Import?**

- **Ultra-fast builds & loads:** No global bloated CSS‚Äîonly what‚Äôs needed, per-page.
- **Modular:** Easily control which features or UI parts are available on each page or template.
- **Productivity:** Organize content, structure, and appearance via frontmatter and templates without ever editing raw CSS or JS!

---

For a full list of available components and layout examples, [see the documentation](https://ssg.axcora.com/components/).

---

**Tip:**  
When you add or remove components in `css.components` or `js`, the build output will automatically change to include only those assets‚Äîmaking your site lighter and faster.

---

## üß± Ready-to-Use Axcora Components

Axcora ships with a growing library of elegant, production-ready UI components.  
You can use these components directly inside your markdown articles **and** `.axcora` templates using simple, readable tags. The build system will collect and render them as semantic HTML with the appropriate CSS and JS automatically applied.

### Example: Using Components in Markdown & Templates

**Button Component**
```markdown
{% axcora-button text="Click Me" href="/" color="primary" /%}
```

**Accordion Component**
```markdown
{% axcora-accordion 
    id="demo"
    title1="Axcora Accordion"
    text1="hello world lorem ipsum dolor"
    title2="Axcora Accordion 2"
    text2="hello world lorem ipsum dolor 2"
    title3="Axcora Accordion 3"
    text3="hello world lorem ipsum dolor 3"
/%}
```

You can use these tags inside your `.md` content or `.axcora` templates.  
**Each component tag will be rendered into styled HTML and only the required CSS/JS will be included in the final build.**

---

### üî• Popular Components

- `{% axcora-button %}` ‚Äì Stylish buttons with color, link, and icon support.
- `{% axcora-accordion %}` ‚Äì Expandable/collapsible content areas.
- `{% axcora-badge %}` ‚Äì Highlighted badges for status and info.

### üöÄ **How It Works**

1. **Add components in your markdown or `.axcora` template** using their respective tags and desired attributes.
2. **Declare the required components in your frontmatter** under `css.components` and `js` (see previous section), or set them globally in your layout.
3. **Axcora SSG automatically renders the component HTML and bundles/minifies only the CSS/JS you use** for each page.

---

> For a full list of available components, usage options, and demos, see the [Axcora Components Documentation](https://ssg.axcora.com/components/).

This makes building advanced, modular static sites fast, intuitive, and fully customizable‚Äîno manual JavaScript or CSS imports needed. Use components where you want them, and enjoy optimal performance by design.
